Remaken meta-dependency tool documentation

= Remaken packaging structure
== Default behavior

== Package tree
package_name/package_version/
package_name-package_version_remakeninfo.txt (or libname ??)
remaken-package_name.pc (should be renamed to remaken-*.pc ?)
interfaces/
lib/[arch]/[mode]/[config]/


== Package metadata
An information file is created in the target package.
The file is named [TARGET]-[VERSION]_remakeninfo.txt
It contains the following informations :
- platform : the supported compiler/platform version
- cppstd : the c++ standard used
- runtime : the runtime used (windows flag indicating whether the target uses the static or the dynamic runtime)

== Dependencies declaration file
For each project, a packagedependencies.txt file can be created in the root project folder.
Each line follows the pattern :

framework#channel|version|library name [% condition1 [% condition2]]...|identifier@repository_type|repository_url|link_mode|options

where repository_type is a value in:
- b-com
- github
- vcpkg
- conan
- system
- path : local or network filesystem root path hosting the dependencies

Conditions separated with % are compilation defined flags (i.e. -DCOMPILFLAG) used to toggle the dependency.
It allows to build the package with several features enabled or not, and uses the underlying dependencies only when the feature is set.

Conditions are set in the "library name" section, after the library name

link_mode is an optional value in :
- static
- shared
- default (inherits the project's link mode)
- na (not applicable)

When link_mode is not provided :
- For remaken (b-com and github), system and vcpkg dependencies link_mode is set to "default"
- For conan, link_mode is set to "na"

(Conan note : link_mode is mandatory if the targeted dependency needs the option. When link_mode is not provided or is set to "na", it is not forwarded to conan, has some packages (typically header only libraries) don't define this option and setting the option leads to an error).

when repository_type is not specified :
- it defaults to b-com when identifier is either remakenBuild or thirdParties (and in this case, the identifier is also the destination subfolder where the dependencies are installed)

- it defaults to system when identifier is one of yum, apt, pkgtool, pkgutil, brew, macports, pacman, choco, zypper

For other repository types (github, vcpkg, conan, system) when the identifier matches the repository type,
the repository type reflects the identifier value - i.e. identifier = conan means repository_type is set to conan.

when identifier is not specified :
- @repository_type is mandatory

when channel is not specified, it defaults to stable for conan dependencies.
For b-com and github repositories, channel can be a combination of values from the remaken packaging manifest.
It is not used for other kind of repos.

options are directly forwarded to the underlying repository tool.
Note : to provide specific options to dedicated system packaging tools, use one line for each specific tool describing the dependency. (once installed, system dependencies should not need specific options declarations during dependencies' parsing at project build stage. Hence the need for the below sample should be close to 0, except for packaging tools that build package upon install such as brew and macports and where build options can be provided).
For instance :
eigen|3.3.5|eigen|system|https://github.com/SolarFramework/binaries/releases/download
eigen|3.3.5|eigen|brew@system|https://github.com/SolarFramework/binaries/releases/download|default|-y
eigen|3.3.5|eigen|pkgtool@system|https://github.com/SolarFramework/binaries/releases/download|default|--S --noconfirm


Sample repositories declarations :
opencv|3.4.3|opencv|thirdParties|https://github.com/SolarFramework/binaries/releases/download
xpcf|2.1.0|xpcf|remakenBuild|https://github.com/SolarFramework/binaries/releases/download|static|
spdlog|0.14.0|spdlog|thirdParties@b-com|https://github.com/SolarFramework/binaries/releases/download
eigen|3.3.5|eigen|system|https://github.com/SolarFramework/binaries/releases/download
fbow|0.0.1|fbow|vcpkg|https://github.com/SolarFramework/binaries/releases/download
boost|1.68.0|boost|conan|https://github.com/SolarFramework/binaries/releases/download
freeglut#testing|3.0.0|freeglut|user@conan|https://github.com/SolarFramework/binaries/releases/download

github, b-com and path dependencies are installed using remaken packaging format through an url or filesystem repository.
system dependencies are installed using operating system dependent package manager (apt for linux debian and derivatives, brew for Mac OS X, chocolatey for windows...)
conan dependencies are installed using packaging format with conan package manager
vcpkg dependencies are installed using vcpkg packaging format with vcpkg package manager

WARNING : using system without any OS option implies the current system the tool is run on.
Moreover, some OSes don't have a package manager, hence don't rely on system for android cross-compilation for instance.

= Qmake informations

== Common project structure
TARGET : defines the project name, usually final binary name
FRAMEWORK : defines a common package name for several libraries
INSTALLSUBDIR : defines an install subdirectory for package home directory
VERSION : defines version of the project

include template*.pri file (after TARGET, FRAMEWORK, INSTALLSUBDIR, VERSION declarations)

== define configuration

CONFIG defines how to build the current target
--> [static | staticlib] builds the target as a static library/application
--> [shared | dll] builds the target as a static library/application

DEPENDENCIESCONFIG defines how to search and which dependencies to use
--> [sharedlib | shared] search and use dependencies as shared libraries
--> [staticlib | static] search and use dependencies as static libraries
--> [recursive | recurse] search dependencies recursively from other remaken packagedependencies information files
--> [install] install first level shared dependencies with the target
--> [install_recurse] search dependencies recursively (see [recursive]) and install all shared dependencies with the target

== ignore dependencies install
to ignore some specific dependencies install, define a 'packageignoreinstall.txtâ€™ file in the root project folder.
define each framework ignored (as defined in packagedependencies.txt) with the pattern :
    framework1 framework2
or
    framework1 
    framework2

== Use project with Qt Vs Tools

Qt Vs tools is a Visual Studio plugin for manage a qmake project in Visual Studio by generating a msvc project
Information : https://doc.qt.io/qtvstools/index.html
Download : https://download.qt.io/development_releases/vsaddin/

define project for use with Qt Vs Tools :
PROJECTCONFIG = QTVS
allows to enable debug and release configurations, install of the package, DEPENDENCIESCONFIG flags 'install' or 'install_recurse' in msvc project generated 

to manage 'install' or 'install_recurse' with QTVS, include remaken_install_target.pri at the end od the .pro file

declare QTVS config before include template*.pri file

== Product information
Defined in _ProductConfig.pri local project file
PRODUCT_NAME::
PRODUCT_DESCRIPTION::
PRODUCT_MANUFACTURER:: sample = b<>com
PRODUCT_MANUFACTURERCODE:: = bCom
PRODUCT_GUID:: example = 5855BF98-D32C-414C-BCA3-860BB8B4576E

PRODUCT_VERSIONCODE:: =hexadecimal based versioning

PRODUCT_VERSION:: derived from project $${VERSION}
PRODUCT_VERSIONSTRING:: derived from project ="$${VERSION}"

== Library Target

== Application Target

== Bundle/plugin Target

== Audio plugins specific files/variables
=== _JuceConfig.pri local project file
Starts with _ProductConfig.pri inclusion
# Declare which plugin format(s) to build
QMAKE_JUCEAUDIOCONFIG:: defines the audio plugin formats to be built (sample : juceAU juceVST juceAAX juceVST3)
Supported values:

For each format declared in QMAKE_JUCEAUDIOCONFIG, the plugin category must be defined, for instance :
JUCEPLUGIN_CATEGORY.juceAU = kAudioUnitType_Effect
JUCEPLUGIN_CATEGORY.juceAUv3 = kAudioUnitType_Effect
JUCEPLUGIN_CATEGORY.juceVST = kPlugCategSpacializer
JUCEPLUGIN_CATEGORY.juceVST3 = kPlugCategSpacializer
JUCEPLUGIN_CATEGORY.juceAAX = AAX_ePlugInCategory_SoundField
JUCEPLUGIN_AUV3TAGS = Effects

The plugin code is a 4 digit code and must be defined
JUCEPLUGIN_PLUGINCODE="H2Sk"
